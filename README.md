# create-zec-app

Boilerplate Zcash => MVC app

This is incomplete.

#### Plan

- Create a developer resource for quickly bootstrapping a fullstack application with controls and content based on events on the Zcash blockchain.
- Use zecwallet-cli so apps are affordable to run as well as quick to start
- Use react/express/sqlite/zcash to make a ZECpages-like PoC
  - Should be able to map transactions to posts
  - List transactions, list by address
  - Should be able to send a transaction
  - Monitor sync process
  - (maybe): 
    - Support view key imports
    - Monitor note availability
